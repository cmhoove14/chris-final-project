# Introduction  
* Development as a driver of infectious disease control and elimination
  * Current strategies to control infectious diseases of poverty/Neglected tropical diseases do not attempt to complement or take advantage of development
* Current global strategy for schistosomiasis control and elimination relies on mass drug administration (MDA), which is plagued by reinfection  
* Reliance on MDA based on quick reductions in morbidity, but does not consider DALYs accumulated over long time periods
* Control and elimination strategies that complement development by considering longterm goals of elimination may be more effective in reducing cumulative burden over medium to long tim horizons  
* Optimal control theory/stochastic dynamic programming used to explore optimal strategies in managed systems with uncertainty
